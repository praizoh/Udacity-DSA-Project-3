Trie node class defines a Trie algorithm, with methods to insert words, and a recursive function to return word related to a suffix.

Efficiency of the insert() method
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: 0(N)

Efficiency of the find() method
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)

Efficiency of the Suffices() method
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(nm) where n is the maximum depth of the recursion tree and m is the space it takes each recursion
to execute.
