I used the binary search algorithm to solve this problem. Using iteration, I looped through numbers between 0 and the given number.
Comparing the squares of each number during iteration, I was able to predict a floored square-root of the given number.
The time complexity for this solution is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(1).
