An http Router handler implemented using Trie Algorithm.

Router:
Efficiency of the add_handler() method
Time complexity: O(1)
Space complexity: O(1)

Efficiency of the lookup() method
Time complexity: O(1)
Space complexity: O(1)


RouteTrie:
Efficiency of the insert() method
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: 0(1)

Efficiency of the find() method
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)

RouteTrieNode:
Efficiency of the insert() method
Time complexity: O(1)
Space complexity: 0(1)

Efficiency of the split_path() method
Time complexity: O(1)
Space complexity: 0(1)

Overall(Modular Complexity), the space complexity is 0(1) and time complexity is O(n)
