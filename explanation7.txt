An http Router handler implemented using Trie Algorithm.

Router.init
Time complexity: O(1)
Space complexity: O(1)

Router.add_handler()
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)

Router.lookup()
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)

RouteTrie.init
Time complexity: O(1)
Space complexity: 0(1)

RouteTrie.insert()
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: 0(n)

RouteTrie.find()
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)

RouteTrieNode.init()
Time complexity: O(1)
Space complexity: 0(1)

RouteTrieNode.insert()
Time complexity: O(1)
Space complexity: 0(1)

split_path()
Time complexity: O(1)
Space complexity: 0(1)

Overall(Modular Complexity), the space complexity is 0(1) and time complexity is O(n)
